## Nebula Finance ðŸŒŒ

How to get started: ```git clone``` ```npm install``` ```npm run dev```

## Inspiration
The Inspiration behind this project came to us after we noticed how many people struggle with their finances and we wanted to change this by simplifying how people manage their finances and to empower users to make better and more informed decisions with the help of a personalized and intuitive tool.

## What it does
Nebula Finance tracks user spending, budgets, and offers AI driven insights that are based on user data because we want the users to have personalized advice that works for them. We also help users manage their finances effectively by providing a useful and easy to understand graph that displays the budget overview. Along with that we added added Image recognition so that our users are able to better understand financial documents that may have seemed daunting in the past. Lastly we want to know that we are doing the best we can for our users so we have a functional contact page so that we can continue to further improve the user experience.

## How we built it
We built Finance Nebula by using modern web technologies which include Next.js for the frontend, TypeScript for type safety, tRPC for API communication, Tailwind CSS for styling, NextAuth for authentication, and Drizzle ORM for database management. We integrated the Gemini API for our AI features, Git so that we would be able to work together and Notion so that we could have a good workflow through assigned tasks.

## Challenges we ran into
A challenge that we ran into was having Gemini access the user data and then having it give personalized insights while ensuring data accuracy. We also had trouble with storing input user data and then accurately displaying that data on the graph along with the info cards on the dashboard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have successfully built an intuitive platform with advanced features, real time financial insights and an amazing user experience. We are also glad to have been able to work together as a team and to be able to get the majority of the features of the personalized AI feature into our project.

## What we learned
We learned how to effectively integrate AI with financial data, how to create an intuitive user-centered design, and how to improve our workflow through web apps such as notion.

## What's next for Nebula Finance
We plan to continue to add more AI capabilities into our Web App such as voice recognition and personalized quizzes and resources that are available to the user so that they can as learn as much as they want to. We also want to add more financial planning tools, and to enhance the user experience with more interactive features.
